# S32DS_EnvControlShaman
Automate and standardize environment setup, management and controll for S32 Design Studio across multiple machines and developers.
**Ensures everything is where it should be, so you don't have to.**

## Overview

As many know, it’s hard enough to install the S32DS correctly once. Now imagine you have two machines, or even worse, two developers...

It’s my own nightmare to manage this manually rn, and therefore here we go.

### What S32DS EnvControlShaman Offers

shit empty repo atm, working on alpha [shrug]  
what is the plan ? [see the requirements-and-planning.md](requirements-and-planning.md)

#### Main Goal for alpha

A clean install on a new machine. Kick off the Shaman to use the p2 director of Eclipse to install whatever you need.
